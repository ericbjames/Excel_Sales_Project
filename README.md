# Excel_Sales_Project
## Overview
- Used Python (Pandas) to clean a years worth of sales data from a mock technology retail company containing over 180,000 rows.
- Visualized and gained insights from data by building a dashboard through Excel which included sales by city, product, and time.

### Original Data Formatting
Without cleaning and formatting the data, no insights could have been gained. The data came in individual month .csv files with many blanks and duplicated values.

# Analysis

## Insights:
- October and December had the highest sales of the year. 
- 12:00 and 19:00 were the times with the highest sales.
- Cell phones, laptops, and headphones accounted for over 70% of sales.
- San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York accounted for 53% of total sales.
- Apple products accounted for 55% of total sales.

## Actionable steps for the business:
- Look at the current strategy for attaching accessories to a purchase. Better store positioning, add-on deals, or website recommendations could boost attach rate. This should also include adding more accessories based on market research that pair well with the siteâ€™s most sold products: iPhone, Google phone, MacBook Pro, and ThinkPad.
- Focusing marketing efforts on the typical customer during a given period such as a students/parents during back to school season should increase sales year-over-year.

## Points for further analysis:
- What deals were active during October and December? What part did back to school season and holiday have on the best months?
- What is the typical customer profile? Student or business?
- Gaining access to data for the profit/loss of products would help decide on which products to remove and which to keep stocked.
